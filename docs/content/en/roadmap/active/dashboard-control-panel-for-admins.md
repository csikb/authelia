This feature will pave the way to adding lots of useful administrator facing features. It will require in database
settings storage as well as some minimal traditional settings via files or environment variables.

This feature should not be confused with the [Dashboard / Control Panel for Users](dashboard-control-panel-for-users.md)
which is the dashboard for the user self-managing their own settings, as this feature is for managing the system
settings instead of the user settings.
